As mentioned in the lectures, modern ML engineering is moving towards pipeline automation for rapid iteration and experiment tracking. This is especially useful in production deployments where models need to be frequently retrained to catch trends in newer data.\n",

It is deployed on top of a Kubernetes cluster and builds an infrastructure for orchestrating ML pipelines and monitoring inputs and outputs of each component.

If not, you can see the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you are using Docker for Desktop (Mac or Windows), you may need to increase the resource limits to start Kubeflow Pipelines later. You can click on the Docker icon in your Task Bar, choose `Preferences` and adjust the CPU to 4, Storage to 50GB, and the memory to at least 4GB (8GB recommended). Just make sure you are not maxing out any of these limits (i.e. the slider should ideally be at the midpoint or less) since it can make your machine slow or unresponsive. If you're constrained on resources, don't worry. You can still use this notebook as reference since we'll show the expected outputs at each step. The important thing is to become familiar with this Kubeflow Pipelines before you get more hands-on in the assignment.\n",

(**NOTE: This lab was tested using `kind v0.20` running `Kubernetes v1.27.2`. You can check the default Kubernetes image used by the `kind` version you are about to download in the \"Breaking Changes\" section [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases). If you want to use the same image, you can use the `--image` flag when creating the cluster (e.g. `kind create cluster --image=kindest/node:v1.27.2`). After creating the cluster, you can check the Kubernetes version with the command `kubectl version`.**)\n",

Instead of hardcoding the URL in your code, you can design your function to accept an *input* string parameter so you can use other URLs in case the data has been transferred.\n",

        "* For the *output*, you will want to pass the downloaded dataset to the next task (i.e. data splitting). You should assign this as an `Output` type and specify what kind of artifact it is. Kubeflow provides [several of these](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/sdk/python/kfp/v2/components/types/artifact_types.py) such as `Dataset`, `Model`, `Metrics`, etc. All artifacts are saved by Kubeflow to a storage server. For local deployments, the default will be a [MinIO](https://min.io/) server. The [path](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/sdk/python/kfp/v2/components/types/artifact_types.py#L51) property fetches the location where this artifact will be saved and that's what you did above when you called `df.to_csv(output_csv.path, index=False)`\n",

The [documentation](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/sdk/python/kfp/v2/components/component_decorator.py#L23) shows several parameters you can set and two of them are used in the code above. As the name suggests, the `packages_to_install` argument declares any extra packages outside the base image that is needed to run your code. As of writing, the default base image is `python:3.7` so you'll need `pandas` and `openpyxl` to load the Excel file.\n",

You don't have to redo your code again in a notebook in your next project as long as you have this YAML file. You can also pass this to your team members or use it in another machine. Kubeflow also hosts other reusable modules in their repo [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/components). For example, if you want a file downloader component in one of your projects, you can load the component from that repo using the [load_component_from_url](https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kfp.components.html#kfp.components.ComponentStore.load_component_from_url) function as shown below.

You'll see more features implemented there such as integration with Tensorboard and more output visualizations from each component.\n",
